# PHASE-3-PROJECT
MODELING AND CLASSIFICATION 
## Business Understanding
Churn is a critical business problem for companies, especially those  telecommunications and other industries with recurring customer interactions. The cost of acquiring new customers typically exceeds the cost of retaining existing ones.By predicting which customers are likely to churn, the company can focus on retaining them, improving customer satisfaction, and ultimately boosting long-term profitability

## Objective

 The goal of this churn rate prediction model is to identify customers who are at risk of leaving the service (churning), 
 enabling the business to take proactive actions such as targeted marketing or personalized offers to retain them.




## Key Metrics to Track:
 - **Churn Rate**: Percentage of customers who leave in a given period.

- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: How valuable a customer is over the long term.

 - **Retention Rate**: The percentage of customers retained over a given period.

### Conclusion:
1. **Model Performance**: Of the models examined, the Random Forest model performed the best, with an accuracy of 95.65%.   This demonstrates that the Random Forest model is quite effective in predicting customer attrition.

2. **Key Predictors**: The investigation found that customer service calls, total day minutes, and total charge are all important predictors of turnover.  Customers that have a high day-minute use and make numerous customer service calls are more likely to churn.

3. **Feature Engineering**: The additional features engineered, such as international usage, average call duration, and total charge, contributed to improving the model's performance.

### Recommendations:
1. **Focus on Customer Service**: Since customer service calls are a significant predictor of churn, improving customer service quality and reducing the number of calls can help in retaining customers. Implementing proactive customer service measures can address issues before they lead to churn.

2. **Targeted Marketing**: Use the churn prediction model to identify high-risk customers and implement targeted marketing strategies, such as personalized offers and discounts, to retain them.

3. **Monitor High Usage Customers**: Customers with high day-minute usage and total charges are more likely to churn. Monitoring these customers and providing them with tailored plans or incentives can help in reducing churn.

4. **Continuous Model Improvement**: Regularly update and retrain the model with new data to ensure its accuracy and effectiveness. Incorporate feedback from marketing and customer service teams to refine the model further.

5. **Customer Feedback**: Collect and analyze customer feedback to identify common pain points and address them promptly. This can help in improving customer satisfaction and reducing churn.
